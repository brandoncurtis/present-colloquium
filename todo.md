List of figure

+ state space model illustrating linear and nonlinear regions
+ constraint violation with PID

group meeting schedule change due to timing of AIChE

lots of visuals
	Mettleman - head & neck
		similar to Kinpen
	video of device
	less talking about it, more showing

gas temperature
surface temperature

motivate control-oriented model

control:
 - simple
 - easy to tune
 - rejects disturbances
 - setpoint

zero process control so far
 - control flowrate
 - doctor's responsibility, _by hand_

dose analogy to radiation, thermal exposure

colloquium: difficult to understand the context of an advancement


PID limitations


MPC
  - multiple inputs
  - multiple outputs


video of intensity control over surfaces

multivariable analysis

----

states - means a different thing in control, thermo,


colloquium - show people what everyone is working on
